            The HTML <head> element is used as a container for metadata (data about data). It is used between <html> tag and <body> tag.
                <br><br>
                The head of an HTML document is a part whose content is not displayed in the browser on page loading. It just contains metadata about the HTML document which specifies data about the HTML document.
                <br><br>
                An HTML head can contain lots of metadata information or can have very less or no information, it depends on our requirement. But head part has a crucial role an HTML document while creating a website.
                <br><br>
                Metadata defines the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.
